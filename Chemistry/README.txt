Overview:
This is a simple program which takes your data and inputs it into a graph where the
program fits a polynomial to the data.

Requirements:
You must have Octave - 3.2.4 or higher installed.

Usage:
1. 	Input your data into the data.dat file - the values must be in the format X, Y. Every
	set of X and Y must be in a new line.

2. 	Change the directory in Octave to where you have both the Predict.m and
	data.dat files.

3.	Run the program by executing "Predict" in the Octave terminal.

4.	Follow the directions in the terminal.

5.	If you like save the outputted graphs when prompted by putting in the filename,
	followed by the extension. ex. "graph.png"
